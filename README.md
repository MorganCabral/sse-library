# sse-library [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/MorganCabral/sse-library.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/MorganCabral/sse-library)

A CMS driven library book management system built on top of Django. This is being developed by the Society of Software Engineers at RIT. More to come in the fall....

## Installation

Download and run the library's install script with this bit of code:

`bash <(curl https://raw.github.com/MorganCabral/sse-library/master/install.sh -o -)`

This script tries to automagically install prereqs for you with your package
manager. If you do not have apt-get, yum, or pacman, you will need to [install
Curl, Git, Python 2.7.x and PIP
manually](https://github.com/MorganCabral/sse-library/wiki/Installation-Prereqs).
If you are on a Mac, read the [Homebrew and
Python](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/Homebrew-and-Python) article. You
can run the install script again when you have the prereqs installed.
